# matplotlib-challenge

This challenge was to look at mice data for various drug regimens.  The following tables and charts were formed:
* Summary table showing the statistics of the tumor volume for each drug regimen
* Bar plot using both Panda's and Matplotlib to show the number of mice per time point for each treatment regimen
* Pie plot using both Panda's and Matplotlib to show the male/female distribution of mice in the study
* Summary table showing the quartiles, IQR, lower bound and upper bound for the 4 most promising treatment regimens on the final data measurement of tumor volume - this was used to determine if there were any outliers
* Box and whisker plot demonstrating the same values as the previous summary table
* Line plot showing timepoint vs tumor volume for a single mouse on the Capomulin treatment
* Scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for mice on the Capomulin treatment - a linear regression was also performed and the resulting line, equation and R-squared values were placed on scatter plot

3 observations were made on the resulting tables/charts and was summarized at the beginning of the notebook
